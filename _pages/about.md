Welcome to my personal page. Learn more about my research interests and my latest news here! 

I'm currently a second-year PhD student at ENS and Inria, under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](thoth.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) and [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/). My research focuses on kernel methods in all sort of flavours, but I'm also interested in providing fast and reliable implementation -- soon to be in Rust !
