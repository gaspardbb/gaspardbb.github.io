Welcome to my personal page. Learn more about my research interests and my latest news here! 

I'm currently a second-year PhD student at ENS and Inria, under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](thoth.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) and [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/). My research focuses on theoretical properties of kernel methods in all sorts of flavour, but I'm also interested in providing fast and reliable implementation of my research projects. 

Currently, I'm interested in non-convex optimization, and I'm enthusiastic about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/), which I hope to use for my research along with Python!

Before that, I graduated from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu) (X2016) and got a master from École Normale Supérieure in Mathematics, Vision and Machine Learning in 2020 ([Master MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)).
