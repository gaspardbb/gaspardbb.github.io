I'm currently a research scientist in Machine Learning and Optimization at [Alice & Bob](https://alice-bob.com/), to help design *cat qubits* to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing. Specifically, I work on simulating quantum systems, chips calibration and state measurements with a mix of learning, optimization, optimal control and experiment design. The intersection between quantum physics and ML&Opt is fascinating! 

Before that I obtained a PhD from ENS and Inria, under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](thoth.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) and [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/). My research focused on theoretical properties of kernel methods in all sorts of flavour. I'm also interested in scientific computing in general, and an user of Julia, Jax, and various flavours of functional programing. Find the manuscript [here](assets/pdf/thesis.pdf)! 

**I'm always opened to academic collaborations. Don't hesitate to reach out!**

*And before that*, I graduated from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu) (X2016) and got a master from École Normale Supérieure in Mathematics, Vision and Machine Learning in 2020 ([Master MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)).
