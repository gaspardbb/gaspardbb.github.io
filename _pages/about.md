Welcome to my personal page. Learn more about my research interests and my latest news here! 

I'm currently a third-year PhD student at ENS and Inria, under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](thoth.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) and [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/). My research focuses on theoretical properties of kernel methods in all sorts of flavour, but I'm also interested in providing fast and reliable implementation of my research projects. 

Currently, I'm interested in non-convex optimization, and I'm enthusiastic about [Elixir](https://www.elixir-lang.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and various flavors of functional programming languages.

Before that, I graduated from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu) (X2016) and got a master from École Normale Supérieure in Mathematics, Vision and Machine Learning in 2020 ([Master MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)).

Starting January 2024 I am opened to job positions. I am a creative problem solver, looking for impactful applications in machine learning and optimization. Here are my [publications](publications) and [resume](cv)!
